Pophelper 2.3.0 is a R package that can be used to plot the struture figure. 
The detailed tutorials could be found in: http://www.royfrancis.com/pophelper/articles/index.html

*Installation
#install the packages 
install.packages(c("devtools","ggplot2","gridExtra","gtable","label.switching","tidyr"),dependencies=T)
install.packages('pophelper')
# load library
library(pophelper)

The next step is to set the working directory. The working directory is a folder that usually contains the run files of interest so as to allow R to access it. 

*Input files 
(this protocol is specifically for the analysis of fastSTRUCTURE)
The input file for fastSTRUCTURE should be the meanQ file. Use the readQ in Pophelper to read the data into R and covert to a 'qlist' filetype.

use 'attributes' to check the facts of the data, like number of individual, the number of k.
